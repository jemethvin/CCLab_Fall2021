    <p>Please, make yourself at home here in my jacuzzi. I installed it on this page to reach the required jpeg count; pretty nice, huh? Ahhh...</p>
    <p>My name's John, of course, and I'm a sophomore here at NYUSH this Fall 2021 semester. I'm a big fan of old-school, European-style dance music, and am loving the fact I get to share it here.</p>
    <p>I'm also digging this creative coding class. Cannot wait to take more in the future and make more great use of online data as I am right now.</p>
